# Defeat The Cat Wizard

This web mini-game provides the player with a variable number of randomly generated cat images. When an image is selected, all images are shuffled. To win the game and defeat the cat wizard, the player has to pick all images without duplication. The current and best scores are tracked.

## Features Used in This Project

- React State for updating data & display in real-time.

## Remaining To-Do List

- Fetch 10 cat images from catAPI and store appropriately.
- Display the cat images.
- Create function to shuffle cat images on mount / player selection.
